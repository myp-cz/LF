# Idea

Standalone control and driver board, a contrallable generator of four interconnected SPWM outputs, directly suitable for FET/etc. H-bridge driving.

The goal is to provide an totaly clear open-source solution of such a driver, including HW and FW contents.

# Global Integration

LF Driver Board is a part of a complete system. You can build any complete system as you want.

We are providing the following complete example: Main LF Power Board + LF Driver Board + "SDS-STSW"
